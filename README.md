"3D-Graphics-and-Animation" is a repository that showcases 3D graphics and animation work. Inside this repository, you'll find various assets and projects related to 3D graphics and animation.

Contents:

    Render Folder:
        This folder contains both a basic render created using Blender and a more advanced render created using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). The Blender project files are available for the basic render. However, due to its large size, the UE5 render project files are not included.

    Animation Folder:
        Inside this folder, you'll find "Animation.md," which provides explanations and insights into the animation creation process.
        Additionally, there's a video file named "Video.mp4" showcasing the Unreal Engine 5 render. Please note that this file may have had size-related issues in the past.

    Updated Unreal Project:
        The repository includes a lighter version of the Unreal Engine project.
        There's also a new version of the animation created with this updated project, titled "VideoFinal.mp4," which includes additional features.

This repository serves as a portfolio of 3D graphics and animation work. Please explore the contents to see the final results of the projects and gain insights into the animation process.
